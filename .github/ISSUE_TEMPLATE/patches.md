Please provide specific links to each of the patches, with checksums for both the original and the patched ROMs.

If a source ROM requires a header, those header bytes should be provided. This is required for some ancient SNES patches that may expect specific header bytes (not an issue for modern SNES patches that typically use a headerless no-intro SNES ROM). Header bytes for both source and patched NES ROMs should always be provided.

Patched SNES ROMs should always be headerless.

CUE sheet contents should always be provided for optical disc images.

Please refer to our [naming conventions](https://github.com/frederic-mahe/Hardware-Target-Game-Database/wiki/Guidelines-for-SMDB-creators#how-to-name-entries).
